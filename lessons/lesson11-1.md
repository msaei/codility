```
def solution(N, P, Q):
    # write your code in Python 3.6
    # get primes between 2 and second rute of N which is O(N^1/2loglogN^1/2))
    # get semiprimes between 2 and N which is O(number of primes ^ 2)
    # get create acculumutive sum for numbers between 1, N O(N)
    # iterate through P and Q and calculate the result using sum array O(N)
    pass
